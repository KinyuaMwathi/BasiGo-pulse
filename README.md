- Covers **routes, trips, telematics, financials, and maintenance**
- Serverless setup on AWS (S3, Redshift, QuickSight)
- Business-ready dashboards

- **Amazon Redshift Serverless** → Scalable data warehouse
- **AWS IAM** → Access and security management
- **Amazon QuickSight** → BI dashboards and visualization
- **Python (Pandas, Faker, NumPy)** → Mock data generation

## 📊 Dashboard
Access the BasiGo Pulse dashboard: [View Dashboard](https://basigo-pulse-public-dashboard.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BasiGo-Pulse-Dashboard.pdf)

- The link above leads to a PDF document rather than a live dashboard. This is due to limitations with Amazon QuickSight Standard Edition, which doesn't support sharing live dashboards publicly without authentication.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KinyuaMwathi/BasiGo-pulse.git
cd BasiGo-pulse
```

### 2. Generate mock data
```bash
bashpython src/data_gen/data_generator.py
```

This creates CSVs in the ./data/ folder.

### 3. Create Redshift tables
Run the DDL scripts from src/db/schema.sql in Amazon Redshift Query Editor v2 to set up the raw schema (routes, trips, telematics, financials, maintenance).

### 4. Load CSV data into Redshift
Use Redshift COPY commands to load your CSVs from S3 into the tables.

### 5. Build dashboards
Connect Amazon QuickSight to Redshift and build interactive dashboards for:

- Executive Pulse (KPI Summary)
- Passenger trends
- Cost & efficiency
- Maintenance Overview
